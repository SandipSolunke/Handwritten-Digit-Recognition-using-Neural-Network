# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Neural-Network

## Features :
### The model is implemented without using any libreries except numpy and pandas.
### Training Data Accuracy : 97.60714285714286
### Testing Data Accuracy : 94.65476190476191 
### Dataset : MNSIT dataset

## Approach: 
We will approach this project by using a three-layered Neural Network. 

The input layer: It distributes the features of our examples to the next layer for calculation of activations of the next layer.

The hidden layer: They are made of hidden units called activations providing nonlinear ties for the network. A number of hidden layers can vary according to our requirements.

The output layer: The nodes here are called output units. It provides us with the final prediction of the Neural Network on the basis of which final predictions can be made.

### Input Layer : 784 Nuerons
### Hidden Layer : 350 Nuerons
### Output Layer : 10 Nuerons
